## Tema 1 - Now You See Me

### Description:

* This project was meant to develop one's abilities of the handling and 
manipulating linked lists by requiring the implementation of multiple
decks of cards.

* Both the list of decks and the decks themselves (lists of cards) were
stored generically using the common doubly linked list data structure.

* The parsing function used to handle the occuring syntax errors was strtok,
which was used to detect an incorrect number of parameters, or unrecognized
commands.

* Additionally, the decks could be manipulated by several operations, such
as: shuffling a deck, merging two decks, splitting the deck into 2 smaller ones,
reversing the order of the cards inside and sorting the consisting cards. 

* The sort function used a very trivial sorting algorithm, always choosing the
minimum card and adding it to the beginning of the deck and working it's way onwards 
to sort the rest of the cards.

### Personal comments:

* The project aided me to better understand linked list and pointers in general,
being required to pay close attention to memory resources and a more abstract
thinking.

* Most of the functions were implemented with a great attention to time complexity
and with a good, yet neglecting attention to memory resources, excepting the 
sort function which used a tremendously bad algorithm both regarding to the time and
memory complexity (although better than bogo sort on average).
